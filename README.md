# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis is done using Naive Bayes Classifier. Here, every sentence contain either a positive sentiment represented by 1 or a negative sentiment represented by 0. Now, for a test sentence probability of it occuring in both the classes is calculated using Bayes Theorem. The class which gives maximum probability will be the predicted sentiment for that corresponding sentence. Laplace Smoothing is also applied here to account for a zero probability.
